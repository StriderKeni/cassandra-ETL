cassandra-ETL is an ETL project for an imaginary startup called Sparkify. This project create a NOSQL keyspace using Apache Cassandra.

## Getting Started

This project was created using Jupyter Notebook so first, make sure that you have all the tools to open .ipynb files

You can find all the code for the ETL pile in the file ***Project_1B_Cassandra.ipynb***

The purpose of this project is to create tables based on 3 queries that the analytic team needs.
You're going to find all the create statements, insert and select based on those 3 queries.

Feel free to ask question about the code!
